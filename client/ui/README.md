MDN Web Docs Front-End style guide

## Quick Start

You need a reasonably new version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) to run this
project, which also ships NPM which we can use to install
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), the package manager used by this project:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

After that all you have to do to see and/or work on the styleguide is clone (1)
this repo, install its dependencies (2) and start storybook (3):
```
git clone git@github.com:mdn/mdn-fiori.git
yarn
yarn start
```
